# Hello, my name is Amie 👋

### About
#### *Vet Tech*  🐶 
Licensed since 2021, I have experience with canine and feline surgery and anesthesia, and am interested in dental health, nutrition, parasitology, and behavior.  Other experience and interests include equine care and behavior, with a focus on mustangs.  I enjoy my current position as an LVT at a local animal hospital, and am open to contributing to Veterinary related projects by request.     

#### *Web Dev* 💻
After first learning HTML in 1999 (ask me about table layouts and clunky CSS 😆) and CSS a few years later,  I took a jump back into the web development pool in 2023 and then took a deep dive into web3 a few months later.  I enjoy working on projects (I don't see myself at one of the big companies, and I've never done a Leetcode), and seeing how I can merge my Vet Tech skills with my Dev skills.  I'm also interested in learning security research and bug hunting, and finding new ways to add to my skills.
