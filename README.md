# Hello, my name is Amie 👋

### About
#### *Vet Tech*  🐶 
Licensed since 2021, I have experience with canine and feline surgery and anesthesia, and am interested in dental health, nutrition, parasitology, and behavior.  Other experience and interests include equine care and behavior, with a focus on mustangs.  I enjoy my current position as an LVT at a local animal hospital, and am open to contributing to Veterinary related projects by request.     

#### *Web Dev* 💻
After first learning HTML in 1999 (ask me about table layouts and clunky CSS 😆) and CSS a few years later,  I took a jump back into the web development pool in 2023 and then took a deep dive into web3 a few months later.  I enjoy working on projects (I don't see myself at one of the big companies, and I've never done a Leetcode), and seeing how I can merge my Vet Tech skills with my Dev skills.  I'm also interested in learning security research and bug hunting, and finding new ways to add to my skills.

### Projects/ Featured Repos
🌱 *Building in Public...* 🙂
#### Angry Spider
A "for fun" project I made with HTML, CSS, and a touch of JS. One cold and rainy weekend in the Fall, my roommate's then 6 yr old and I were both bored, and ended up coming up with the story, "The Angry Spider who Stole Gems". 🙄 Honestly, I think she came up with most of it, and I mostly was asking her, "Whyyy???" as she added to the story.  A weekend later, it was also cold and now icy outside, so seemed like a good idea to make a landing page for the upcoming new book and practice some responsive design at the same time.
#### Collectible Corner 
A slightly ...bigger... project made with HTML, CSS, and a touch of JS.  Over another cold and rainy week or two in November, it seemed like a good idea to bring back tables like I hadn't seen one in 20 years... 🙄  Call me crazy, or blame the lack of sunlight, but this project got put on hold once I realized the insanity of what I was doing and that there was probably an easier way.  In the late 90s/very early 00s I collected a handful of Magic the Gathering cards because I liked the artwork, but never played.  I had recently found them while sorting through some old things and thought it would be good to practice my development skills by organizing them and researching value.  
#### Dosage calculators
A very work in progress project that currently features a calculator shell made w/ HTML & CSS, and will eventually include calculators for other common veterinary formulas, like fluid rates by weight, etc.  This will likely either be a section on the work QRG project, or merged with it once fully functional. 
#### Work QRG
An attempt to migrate work SOPs from paper to digital, currently using HTML & CSS.
